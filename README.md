NSS Node.JS Exercises: 13 - SQLite Practice

## Instructions

A friend of yours owns a small family business and wants to start moving all of their business records into a database. Using your NodeJS skills, they want you to create a SQLite database to store information about their employees.

1. Create a database that is saved on disk.

1. Create a table titled `employees` with the following columns:
  - id, firstName, lastName, jobTitle, address

1. Create an array of at least 6 objects. Each object should have a key value pair matching each column name in the `employees` table.
  ```js
  eg: let array = [
    { id: 0, firstName: 'Fred', lastName: 'Smith', jobTitle: 'Cashier', address: '500 Somewhere Lane' },
    ...,
  ]
  ```  

1. Insert each of the employee objects into the database.

1. Write a statement to query the database and `console.log()` all employee records.

1. Write a statement to query the database and `console.log()` each employees `jobTitle`.

1. Write a statement to query the database and `console.log()` each employees `firstName`, `lastName` and `address` only.

## Bonus Features

1. Instead of using an array in the .js file, create a JSON file of employees to require into the js file. Use this to populate the table.

1. Your friend has decided that they want to add a salary column to the employees table. Make sure to add a salary key value pair to each of the employee objects. Then drop the existing employees table, update the schema to accept a salary column, and repopulate the table.

1. Write a statement that returns all employees of a specified `jobTitle`.
